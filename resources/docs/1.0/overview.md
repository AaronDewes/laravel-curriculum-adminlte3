# Overview

---

curriculum is a learning platform where teachers can create topic-based learning objectives. The resulting curricula can be linked with learning groups and be viewed by learning group members. This will give students, teachers (and parents) a good overview of the objectives to be achieved. Not yet reached objectives are shown in red - if a objective is achieved, it will be shown in green or orange (if achieved with help). So curriculum provides a good overview of the current learning status. More information at http://www.curriculumonline.de
